## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

I am currently working on:
- Multimodality and sample-efficient training at [Manifold Machines](https://manifold.mk/)
- AI safety research at the [AI Safety Initiative Groningen](https://www.aisig.org/)

I am interested in physics, compositionality in general intelligence. Currently learning more about RL.

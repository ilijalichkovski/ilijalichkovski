## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

A lot of the coding I do these days is aimed at:
- Multimodality and sample-efficient training at [Manifold Machines](https://manifold.mk/)
- AI safety research at the [AI Safety Initiative Groningen](https://www.aisig.org/)

My background is in physics, and working on intelligence is incredibly exciting for me. Currently learning more about RL. Read more about me on https://ilijalichkovski.notion.site/.
